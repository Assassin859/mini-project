## Abstract
This research paper presents an innovative AI-driven business simulation platform that replicates the dynamics of the popular TV show "Shark Tank". The study examines the implementation of sophisticated decision-making algorithms, natural language processing, and game theory principles to create realistic investment scenarios and shark personalities. Through empirical analysis and user testing, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-powered educational gaming in teaching entrepreneurship and business negotiation skills.

## 1. Introduction
### A. Background
Entrepreneurship education faces significant challenges in providing realistic, hands-on experience in business pitching and investment negotiations. Traditional methods often lack the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios and immediate feedback mechanisms. This research introduces an AI-driven simulation platform that addresses these limitations through sophisticated algorithmic decision-making and personalized shark investor personalities.

### B. Problem Statement
- Environment inconsistency across development teams
- Complex setup procedures
- Integration challenges with AI tools
- Tool version management difficulties

### C. Research Objectives
1. Design and implement an AI-driven business simulation platform
2. Develop realistic shark investor personalities with distinct decision-making patterns
3. Create an algorithmic framework for pitch evaluation and investment decisions
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of the simulation in entrepreneurship education
5. Measure the impact on user learning and engagement

## II. Related Work
Previous research in educational gaming and business simulation has explored various aspects of entrepreneurship training [1]. While existing solutions often focus on rule-based systems or simplified scenarios, our approach leverages advanced AI algorithms and natural language processing to create a more dynamic and realistic experience. This study builds upon game theory principles [2], behavioral economics [3], and educational technology research [4] while introducing novel approaches to AI-driven character interaction and decision-making.
Previous research has explored various aspects of development environment standardization [1], containerization [2], and AI assistance in software development [3]. However, the integration of these technologies in a unified solution remains largely unexplored. This study builds upon existing work while introducing novel approaches to environment isolation and AI-assisted development.

## III. System Design and Implementation
### A. Technical Architecture
1. **Frontend Stack**
   - Next.js with TypeScript for type safety
   - Tailwind CSS for responsive design
   - React components for modular UI
   - Real-time state management

2. **Backend Infrastructure**
   - Supabase for backend services
   - Real-time database functionality
   - Serverless functions for game logic
   - WebSocket integration for multiplayer features

3. **AI Components**
   - Custom decision-making algorithms
   - Natural language processing for pitch analysis
   - Personality-driven response generation
   - Dynamic scoring system

### B. Shark Personalities
```typescript
export const SHARKS: Shark[] = [
  {
    id: SharkPersonality.TECH_MOGUL,
    name: 'Alex Chen',
    background: 'Former Silicon Valley CEO',
    netWorth: 2500000000,
    preferredCategories: [BusinessCategory.TECH],
    riskTolerance: 0.8,
    equityPreference: 0.25,
  },
  // Additional sharks with unique personalities
];
```

Each shark investor is modeled with distinct characteristics:
- Risk tolerance (0.0 - 1.0)
- Industry preferences
- Equity requirements
- Investment thresholds
- Personality traits affecting decisions

  // Revenue requirement (25% weight)
  const revenueScore = calculateRevenueScore(pitch, shark);
  // Valuation analysis (20% weight)
  const valuationScore = assessValuation(pitch);
  // Market size impact (15% weight)
  const marketScore = evaluateMarketSize(pitch);
  // Team experience (10% weight)
  const teamScore = (pitch.teamExperience / 10) * 10;
